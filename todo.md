### ToDo

[X] Allow an account to be re-authenticated, so if there is an issue you don't lose all the books
[ ] Process parts as well as chapters (See Bobiverse: We Are Legion)
[~] Re-implement AAXtoMP3 in-house to enable the titles to be what we specifically set (AAXtoMP3 picks second title which is the title and subtitle combined)

### Features To Add

[ ] Add a calendar showing when books were added to Audible / Unabridged
[ ] Finish the dashboard
[ ] Push-based progress updates
[X] Docker builds in GitHub
[ ] Asynchronous loading of certain data (https://svelte.dev/blog/streaming-snapshots-sveltekit)
[ ] Snapshots to save pending settings changes instead of blocking page navigation (https://svelte.dev/blog/streaming-snapshots-sveltekit)
